											<h4>Robust Online Motion Planning for Segway Robotics Mobility Platform</h4>
											<p>
											This work extends and applies <a href="#Theory">optimization and control theory</a> to autonomous driving task.
											By leveraging both online and offline computation, the proposed framework is able to keep the autonomous provably safe in real-time experiments.
											</p>
											<p>
												The planning framework uses full-order model of the the vehicle to track desired trajecotries in a lower-dimensional subspace.
												A Forward Reachable Set (FRS of the full-order model is first computed <b>offline</b> to capture all possible future states of the vehicle up to some time horizon by accounting for tracking errors.
												This FRS is then used at run-time to map obstacles to constraints for an online MPC, which ensures safe trajectories can be picked in an <b>online</b> fashion.
												To ease the computation burden during real time operation, obstacles are discretized;
												and to ensure feasibility, braking maneuver is introduced as a backup controller in case of planning failure.
												Moreover, the online MPC is solved on GPU using <a href="#BA">Parallel Bernstein Algorithm</a> to greatly improve computation speed and the chance of finding optimal solutions.
											</p>
											<p>
												This method is tested on a Segway platform in an autonomous driving scenario with randomly generated obstacles,
												and has demonstrated faster and more robust than generic methods.

											<h4>Safe, Online Control for <a href="http://www.agilityrobotics.com/robots#cassie">Cassie</a> (Ongoing Work)</h4>
											<p>
												This work focuses on developing a safe, online MPC framework to control a robot <a href="http://www.agilityrobotics.com/robots#cassie">Cassie</a>.
											</p>
											<p>
												Cassie is a 3D biped robot with 10 actuators and 20 degrees of freedom.
												Due to Cassie's high degree of freedom, underactuation, and complex impact model, generating safety guarantees of such system online can be extremely challenging.
												To make reasonable predictions of its future states, Cassie is first programmed to track the motion of a simplistic inverted pendulum model.
												By combining the maximum possible tracking error to predicted motion of the simplistic model, one may obtain a hybrid Forward Reachable Set (FRS) of Cassie
												which contains all possible behaviors of the robot up to some time horizion.
												I am currently developing algorithm to include such FRS as safety constraints for online MPC.

											<h4>Safe, Online Gait Design for <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234651">RABBIT</a> Model</h4>
											<p>
												This work further extends the <a href="#Segway">online motion planning framework</a> to generate an online control framework for legged robots.
												<!-- control planar
												<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234651">RABBIT</a> model in an online fashion. -->
												Formal guarantees of safety is established for such method using reachability analysis techniques for discrete-time systems.
											</p>
											<p>
												We leverage the <a href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/23/3325.short">anchor and template framework</a>
												to construct a simple model (template) whose outputs are sufficient to predict the behavior of the full model's (anchor's) outputs.
												A parameterized Forward Reachable Set (FRS) is first computed offline to describe the evolution of the discrete-time outputs of the simple model.
												By bounding the discrepency between template and anchor models, one may obtain an outer approximation of FRS of the full-order robot.
												This FRS is then fed to an online MPC framework as safety constraints, which are sufficient to ensure N-step walking that does not fall over.
											</p>
											<p>
												The proposed framework is implemented on a 14-dimensional model of the robot <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234651">RABBIT</a> as shown in the above video.
												Unlike generic methods, this approach is capable of performing online computation while preventing the robot from falling.

											<h4>Control Synthesis for Nonlinear Optimal Control via Convex Relaxations</h4>
											<p>
												This work addresses the problem of control synthesis for nonlinear optimal control problems in the presence of state and input constraints.
												The proposed aproach relies upon transforming the given problem into inifinite-dimensional linear program over the space of measures,
												and convergence to global optima is guaranteed as degree of relaxtion goes up.
											</p>
											<p>
												The picture shown above is an illustration of proposed method on an LQR version of the Dubins Car problem.
												The blue circle indicates the given initial state, and the blue dot shows the target point.
												The ground truth solution for such problem is colored in blue, and red lines are control actions generated by our method.
											</p>
											<p>
												This work can be extended to address <a href="#HOCP">hybrid optimal control</a>,
												<a href="https://github.com/ramvasudevan/RTD">reachability analysis</a>,
												<a href="">inverse optimal control</a>, and
												<a href="">stochastic optimal control</a>.

											<h4>Hybrid Optimal Control With Guaranteed Global Convergence</h4>
											<p>
												Many dynamical systems may undergo instantaneous state changes due to satisfaction of certain state-dependent constraints.
												Examples of such systems include legged robots, where the velocity of limbs changes instantaneously due to impacts with the ground.
												<!-- , and ??? -->
												The optimal control of hybrid systems are especially difficult to solve not only because of the discontinuity in states and controls,
												but also due to the combinatorial nature of possible transition sequences.
												State-of-the-art solvers struggle to find globally optimal solutions for these problems under nonliner state and input constraints.
											</p>
											<p>
												This work focuses on extending the <a href="#OCP">convex relaxation-based optimal control framework</a> to solving hybrid systems.
												By introducing measures that capture the trajectories entering and leaving each hybird modes,
												the proposed method is able to find globally optimal trajectories regardless of transition sequence being potentially unknown.
											</p>
											<p>
												As an exmpale, the proposed method is implemented to solve optimal control of a single-leg hopper, as shown in the above images.
												The goal in the first image is to jump as high as possible, and the goal in the second image is to slow down from a large horizontal velocity.
												Other applications include reachability analysis for hybrid systems (e.g.,  <a href="#Robotics">legged robots</a> ).

											<h4>Parallel Bernstein Algorithm for Constrained Global Optimization</h4>
											<p>
												In this work I developed a parallel algorithm for solving optimization problems with polynomial constraints and cost functions (a.k.a. polynomial optimization problems) using Bernstein expansion.
												This approach relies upon bounding the values of polynomials in shrinking subsets of the domain (see the animation on the left),
												and is able to find all global optimizers to polynomial optimization problems within polynomial time.
											</p>
											<p>
												Such algorithm can be implemented on either multi-core CPUs or GPUs to significantly reduce computation time.
												The rate of convergence of such algorithm is proved to be either linear or quadratic, depending on the problem settings,
												and a practical bound on the maximum memory usage is provided.
												This approach is implemented both in MATLAB (CPU) and in CUDA C++ (GPU),
												and proven faster than generic methods on an array of benchmark examples
												as well as in a real-world <a href="#Segway">autonomous driving planning task</a>.
